Wow, today is awesome. It's been a bunch of months since myself and the other ObjectRocket Founders [started][2] ObjectRocket.

We have been tirelessly building something that we are very proud of. Today we officially released it to the world. I have to admit it&#8217;s nerve racking, but also very exciting. We felt early on that we could <del datetime="2013-01-17T04:08:51+00:00">built</del> build a very high quality MongoDB experience, and didn&#8217;t see a lot of competitors doing it the way we wanted. Today we offer the premium MongoDB database-as-a-service (DBaaS). The only solution that is by default highly available, automatically sharded and unbelievably fast. I couldn&#8217;t be more ecstatic and proud of our team. I am humbled by them daily.
