Just getting around to posting this now, it's been an absolutely crazy year. But back in April I spoke at [Percona Live](https://www.percona.com/live/17/), and had a great time. The talk had pretty good turnout and the feedback and questions were awesome. It's always interesting presenting Apache Kafka to database nerds (I'm one) because of it's similarities, yet drastic differences.
