Last night I presented this talk at the [Austin Kafka/Streaming Data Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Apache-Kafka-Meetup-Stream-Data-Platform/). It was a great time with a bunch of really excellent attendees. Lots of good questions and interest. A big thanks to the HomeAway team and especially the organizer Praveen for hosting and setting things up!
